Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
1. Data Cleaning:
● Check for missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset.
● Standardize column names, format dates, and handle any data
inconsistencies.
2. Data Transformation:
● Calculate daily returns for each stock and the indices.
● Create additional features like moving averages, volatility measures, and
relative strength indicators (RSI), etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
3. Descriptive Statistics:
● Calculate and analyse summary statistics for each stock and index.
● Look at the distribution of returns and trading volumes.
4. Correlation Analysis:
● Explore correlations between individual stocks and indices.
● Visualize correlation matrices and identify strong/weak relationships.
5. Sector-wise Analysis:
● Compare and contrast the performance of stocks within each sector.
● Identify sector leaders and laggards.
Time Series Analysis:
6. Trend Analysis:
● Use moving averages to identify trends in stock prices.
● Plot stock prices and indices over time to observe long-term trends.
7. Volatility Analysis:
● Calculate and analyse the volatility of each stock and index.
● Identify periods of high and low volatility.
8. Seasonal Patterns:
● Check for any seasonal patterns or recurring trends in stock prices.
Fundamental Analysis Integration:
9. Financial Ratios:
● Calculate and analyse key financial ratios for each company.
● Compare ratios across companies and sectors.
10. Earnings Analysis:
● Examine the impact of earnings announcements on stock prices.
● Check if there is a correlation between earnings surprises and stock
returns.
Portfolio Optimization:
11. Diversification Analysis:
● Evaluate the benefits of diversification by analysing the correlation and
covariance of different stocks in the portfolio.
12. Risk-Return Analysis:
● Assess the risk and return of individual stocks and the overall portfolio.
● Construct an efficient frontier to find optimal portfolios based on risk
tolerance.
Visualization and Reporting:
13. Interactive Dashboards:
● Use tools like Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
● Include visualizations of key metrics, trends, and portfolio performance.
14. Storytelling:
● Narrate the story of your analysis, highlighting key insights and
observations.
● Provide actionable recommendations based on your findings.
Statistical Modelling (Optional):
15. Predictive Modelling:
● Explore predictive models like ARIMA or machine learning algorithms for
stock price forecasting.
● Evaluate the performance of the models and their predictive power.
Finalizing the Project:
16. Documentation:
● Document your analysis process, code, and key findings.
● Provide clear explanations for your visualizations and models.
17. Presentation:
● Create a visually appealing presentation summarizing your analysis and
insights.
● Clearly communicate your methodology and results.
Remember to continuously iterate and refine your analysis as you uncover new
insights. This project will not only showcase your data analysis skills but also your
ability to derive actionable insights for potential investment decisions
